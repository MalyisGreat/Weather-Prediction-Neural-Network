# Weather-Prediction-Neural-Network
This project details the creation of an expert AI weather forecaster designed to predict not just a single outcome, but also its own confidence for any given day. The final model's true accuracy lies in its ability to provide a nuanced, probabilistic forecast, which is a more honest and useful tool than a simple temperature guess.
